# NumberCounter

NumberCounter is very straight forward. You are given three buttons where the left button is "Decrease", the middle button is "Reset", and the right button is "Increase". The "Decrease" button decrements the counter by 1. The "Reset" button puts the counter back at 0. Last, but not least, the "Increase" button increments the counter by 1.
